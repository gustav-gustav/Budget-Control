# Budget-Control
Its a two file project. The first one creates directories and the deffault files needed for the program to run. Some of them will be deleted when you first use the program and are needed so it doesn't throw errors. The second one is the main program, with all functions, for example: 'add money', 'set limit' and 'spend'.
